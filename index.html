                This is officially my first post on this website, which was created by yours truly. 
                <br>
                I know what you’re thinking, what shit did I just stumble into, but listen.
                <br>
                This undertaking was somewhat a labor of love for me. I’ve been talking about doing this FOREVER and finally its been brought into existence. I’ve been wrestling with what I wanted this project to look like and I kept thinking big, big, big, but what I really needed was small and minimalistic. So I just wanted to say strap in, and if you’re here long enough to notice improvements, thank you sincerely from the bottom of my heart for plowing through this shit with me.
                <br>
                <br>
                Well now that, that’s outta the way I wanted to discuss what goes through any novice’s mind when starting.
                <br>
                <br>

                <strong>WHAT ENGINE OR LANGUAGE SHOULD I START WITH?</strong> 
                <br>
                I think this is the wrong question to consider first, I know because when I started at the beginning of this pandemic summer  I had the same question, and the answer I got back was in the form of a question which was: What are you looking to accomplish?
                <br>
                So for me I really enjoy 3D games, And can see myself someday creating 3D games. With this in mind, came the next step, which was of course my Engine/language of choice. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I picked <strong>Unreal Engine.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Are there better Engines than Unreal? Sure. I picked Unreal for 2 reasons.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                1. I’ve had experience with C++ in college, which is Unreal’s coding language of choice
                <br>
                2. I bought a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/101WeuA0QYd15WR34=/">Udemy</a> course on Unreal years back at the start of my CS degree.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having a course and a background in C++ made it no brainer.
                <br>
                But hold on was it the right choice?
                <br>
                <br>
                Online I’ve found disputes on what Engine is better for 3D games, and I’ve come across Godot, and Unity. Unity is community driven, and just about every conceivable question in regards to developing a video game can be found and most likely already answered.  With Unreal Engine it just recently become “free” (March 2015) to develop with, the community is nowhere equal to that of Unity.
                <br>
                <br>
                Epic games which are the stewards of Unreal makes you the developer understand that its free to create on, but will cost you 5% <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/faq">revenue</a> if and when you sell a game that makes over 1,000,000. 5% of a million is 50,000k… 
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, I don’t really care about that. I should but that’s not the reason why I’m learning  how to create video games. I sincerely just want to learn how to create games and tell stories, and someday ask the gods over at NAUGHTY DOG TO GIVE ME JOB, BECAUSE THE WHOLE REASON I WENT  BACKTO SCHOOL TO LEARN COMPUTER SCIENCE WAS BECAUSE OF THE PROFOUND EFFECT LEFT ON ME AFTER PLAYING THE LAST OF US FOR THE FIRST TIME.
                <br>
                <br>
                Wrapping this up, Choosing what is right for you depends on first asking yourself what it is you’re trying to create. And then I think everything else follows.
